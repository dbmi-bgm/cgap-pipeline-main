CGAP Annotations
================

The cgap-annotations GitHub repository (https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/cgap-annotations) and the related documentation (https://cgap-annotations.readthedocs.io/en/latest) contain information on the data sources used for annotation and the reference files used by the pipelines. If pre-processing is required, they also have information on how to create the processed files used in the pipeline from the raw data sources, and the scripts that are required.

**November 2021** Pipeline-specific annotation scripts that were previously hosted on CGAP Annotations have been moved to the ``dockerfiles`` folders in the appropriate pipeline(s) and documentation for these scripts has been moved from CGAP Annotations to be included here (CGAP Pipeline Main).
