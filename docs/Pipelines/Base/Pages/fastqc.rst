FastQC Check
============

All ``fastq`` files generated by format conversion steps (e.g., ``cram2fastq``) or uploaded to the CGAP Portal undergo a ``FastQC`` run (using ``run.sh`` in the fastqc docker folder) to assess quality and generate a sequencing quality report that is available to the users.
