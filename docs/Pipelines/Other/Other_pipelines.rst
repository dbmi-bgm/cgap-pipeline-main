Other pipelines benefit from the modular nature of CGAP Bioinformatics Pipelines and repositories to allow for open-source collaboration or pipelines that are tailored specifically to our clients' needs. These pipelines can begin from final output files or intermediate files from other pipelines in production to carry out additional analyses not present in the standard base, upstream, or downstream CGAP Pipelines.
