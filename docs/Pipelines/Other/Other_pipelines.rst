The modular nature of CGAP pipelines and repositories allows for open-source contribution and the addition of other algorithms and pipelines on top of our current offering. These pipelines can begin from final output or intermediate files of our current pipelines and provide additional analyses to extend the standard base, upstream, or downstream CGAP Pipelines.
