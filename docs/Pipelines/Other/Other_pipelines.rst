Other Pipelines

The CGAP Pipelines are modular and organized in a repository structure that enables open-source contribution and the streamlined integration of new algorithms and pipelines.
These additions can build upon our current offerings starting from the final output or intermediate files of our existing pipelines and adding additional analyses.
This flexible approach allows for continuous improvement and expansion of the capabilities of CGAP Pipelines.
