=============
GenotypeGVCFs
=============

This step uses GATK ``GenotypeGVCFs`` to genotype variant calls generated by ``HaplotypeCaller``.
For a single sample (i.e., proband-only) this creates a ``vcf`` file from the ``g.vcf`` input file.
For multiple samples (i.e, trio or family), variant calls combined by ``CombineGVCFs`` are jointly genotyped and a ``vcf`` file is created from the combined ``g.vcf`` input file.
The resulting ``vcf`` file is checked for integrity to ensure that the format is correct and the file is not truncated.
